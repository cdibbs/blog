There's a vicious debate between well-meaning Christians and "scientists." Here's how the conversation usually goes:

---

**Scientist**: Your first book the Bible says the earth is very young - only a few thousand years old! That simply cannot be. Science says so.

**Christian**: I take the Bible on Faith! Science must be wrong...

**Scientist**: Every way we have of empirically discerning what is good and true, in the world, says the Earth cannot be that young!

**Christian**: Does faith require evidence? Here, have some out-of-place fossils!

**Scientist**: *sigh*

---

They will continue like this, ad nauseum. Two problems with this:<br />

<div class='post'>
<ol>
<li>Genesis does not say the earth is young.</li>
<li>Neither the Christian, nor the Scientist, read the Bible for comprehension. They want to quickly dismiss the other side's arguments, so they don't invest the time.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<br />
**"What?"** you ask. **"The Bible doesn't say the earth is young?"**

Nope - people have to do lots of very complicated math to get this number.
Nowhere, in the Bible, does God give an explicit date of creation.

**"Ok... and what do you mean by 'read the Bible for comprehension'?"**

Well, it's prudent to give the benefit of the doubt, no? Assume your friends and neighbors aren't stupid. Test the assumption that the idea of God,
in the Bible, is consistent, throughout. What I mean is, look at who Jesus is, since He claimed to be God, and try to work backwards to figure out
what He might've had in mind, when He created the Book of Genesis.

I mean, just think how amazing of a treasure it is, if Jesus is Who He claimed! You have a record of _the only_ perfect being, and how He interacts
with a very... misguided people.

## Working backwards

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
In fact, in his public ministry <strong>he never taught without using parables;</strong> but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.
<div class='source'>
	Mark 4:34
</div>
</div>

So, if Jesus is God, and God wrote Genesis, it would've been very consistent with His character to write Genesis as a non-literal parable. That means you cannot derive meaningful dates through literal interpretation.

Why would He do that? Let's ask...

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of God. But <strong>I use parables to teach the others so that</strong> the Scriptures might be fulfilled: <strong>'When they look, they won't really see. When they hear, they won't understand.'</strong>
<div class='source'>
	Luke 8:10
</div>
</div>

God has no selfish reasons for anything, much less for _forcing_ belief and worship. God is gentle. "WAKE UP PEOPLE! I AM HERE!" is not usually His way. Moreover, we're
a figuratively-minded people - we learn best through stories!

Instead, God is looking for those who will earnestly seek him. God is morally perfect, incorruptable; He cannot be manipulated or controlled, in the ways which come
so easily to our other, human relationships.

**"Ok. God is perfect, and teaches through stories. So, what does this mean for reading Genesis, then?"**

## Reading Genesis

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a <strong>flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</strong>
<div class='source'>
	Genesis 3:24
</div>
</div>

Whoa. The tree of life - sweetness! We want to get there, don't we? But how? Let's break it down. We need to learn what God meant by:

<div class='post'>
<ol>
<li>The flaming sword</li>
<li>The way</li>
<li>The tree of life</li>
</ol>
</div>

Let's start with the flaming sword. Were you to read the Bible, consistently, even just a little at a time, over time, you'd eventually
stumble on one of the many places where swords and flames are used metaphorically, in the New Testament.

Here's one such place:

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
Take the helmet of salvation and the <strong>sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</strong>
<div class='source'>
	Ephesians 6:17
</div>
</div>

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
Then, what looked like <strong>flames or tongues of fire</strong> appeared and settled on each of them. And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.
<div class='source'>
	Acts 2:3
</div>
</div>

There are many more instances, throughout the Bible, where a sword is used as a metaphor for the Word of God (both Jesus, and the Scriptures), and fire is used to represent the Holy Spirit. <strong>So, guarding the Way to the tree of life, we have the big, intimidating Word of God aflame under the Holy Spirit (who helps us to understand it).</strong>

Great. So far, so good. What's the way?

<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
Jesus told him, "<strong>I am the way</strong>, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me."
<div class='source'>
	John 14:6
</div>
</div>

So, to get to the <strong>tree of life</strong>, you have to find Jesus, who comes to our lives, personally, through the <strong>flaming sword.</strong> It's good to remember that Jesus also says he is "the life." We are the tree.

All that from one, little verse, in Genesis.

This isn't to say God couldn't have made the earth only 6000 years ago... it's just that there are more productive
conversations to have. Like the ones that point us to knowing God.


<div class='bible-quote'>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.
<div class='source'>
	John 14:6
