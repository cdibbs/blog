<p>
Walking along the coastline,<br />
with this warm and gentle sunshine,<br />
a breeze tickles through her hair.<br />
Her son whistles a song on the air.

</p>
<p>
Taking some vacation, today,<br />
wanting the morning to play<br />
with her son who doesn't yet know<br />
Of baby sister, now on the way!
</p>
<p>
A light brush,<br />
as familiar fingers,<br />
slide softly under her palm,<br />
and on her cheek,<br />
a quick, gentle touch of the lips,<br />
while, her hand in his, caressing,<br />
our boy's still whistling that song.
</p>
<p>
Along the sand-dusted sidewalks they stroll,<br />
their son wandering in mind and feet,<br />
thinking of his new playmate to come,<br />
and a delicious, noon ice cream treat.
</p>
<p>
She leans into her husband's shoulder, with a smile,<br />
prompting a peck on the lips, his arm to hug her hips,<br />
as she dreams peacefully, for awhileâ€¦
</p>
