<p>
With devastated sobs,<br />
our cool-spirited teen<br />
wipes away teary eyeliner,<br />
begging our esteem.

</p>

<p>
With a flick of flowing hair,<br />
our little baby's pretense?<br />
"I'm doubting you even care!"
</p>

<p>
After all,<br />
our composure lost,<br />
is her composure gained!<br />
</p>

<p>
Baby-sweet eyes,<br />
she still looks up into mother's,<br />
(Another few inches taller,<br />
and she'll look into brother's!)<br />
She looks to justify,<br />
this treasure of the heart,<br />
Daddy wants to cry,<br />
knowing this is just the start!
</p>

<p>
"I know I still have school,<br />
and friends and family, too,<br />
but this boyfriend--he and I...<br />
well, let me explain to you,<br />
The kindness he has shown,<br />
and maturity notwithstanding,<br />
boy, we could have flown,<br />
but here before you, we are standing!"
</p>

<p>
This is true.
</p>

<p>
But daddy tries not to roll his eyes.<br />
After all, it was years from twelve,<br />
by the time he finally found<br />
the treasure he would prize.<br />
He glances over at mom,<br />
the warmth of her smile reveals,<br />
this would take more heart-to-heart,<br />
before they'd feel prepared,<br />
for what was about to start.
</p>
