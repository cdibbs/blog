Walking along the coastline,
with this warm and gentle sunshine,
a breeze tickles through her hair,
her son whistles a song on the air.

Taking some vacation, today,
wanting the morning to play
with her son who doesn't yet know
Of baby sister, now on the way!

A light brush,
as familiar fingers,
slide softly under her palm,
and on her cheek,
a quick, gentle touch of the lips,
while, her hand in his, caressing,
our boy's still whistling that song.

Along the sand-dusted sidewalks they stroll,
their son wandering in mind and feet,
thinking of his new playmate to come,
and a delicious, noon ice cream treat.

She leans into her husband's shoulder, with a smile,
prompting a peck on the lips, his arm to hug her hips,
as she dreams peacefully, for awhileâ€¦
