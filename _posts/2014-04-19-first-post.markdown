Rather than spam everyone on Facebook, I figure a blog is a much better way to express myself. Fortunately, github
had the easy remedy, this time: simply push html ([or Jekyll][jekyll]) to a gh-pages branch, and watch your blog
show up at username.github.io/project. Pretty cool!

For the launch of this blog, I wanted to include a few things:

* [FOLProof][folproof]- originally begun as a class project, it's a language for representing first-order
logic proofs, along with a verifier, and a demo that works, as you type. Try it, here: [FOLProof Demo][foldemo]
* Some poetry I'd written, thanks to some particularly inspirational dreams I'd had. Go [here][poetry].

Please enjoy the fresh content and blog. Let me know what you think!
